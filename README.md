# EventHorizon
EventHorizon for Legion++

Version 2.0 is a work in progress, and functionality, performance, or support is not guaranteed.

This is intended to be a GUI-config based, flexible rewrite of EventHorizon. The main features center around an in-game config and marketplace, allowing players to create/download new functionality and specializations all in-game.
