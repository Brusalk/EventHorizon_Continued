Setting this to a number will set the lower limit accordingly. ie, config.castLine = 0.5 will show all casts over 0.5 seconds. Setting this to 0 will show the line for all casts no matter what.
config.gcdStyle = 'line'        -- 'line' = show a thin line for the GCD. 'bar' = show a full-frame shrinking bar for the gcd (looks good at a dark color and low opacity, set within the color table). false = disable GCD handling.

config.enableRedshift = false      -- Enable Redshift's show/hide functions? Default = false
config.Redshift.showCombat = true     -- Always show EH in combat. Default = true
config.Redshift.showHarm = true      -- Show EH if targeting an attackable unit, in or out of combat. Default = true

config.Redshift.showFocus = false    -- Always show EH while a focus unit exists, in or out of combat. Default = false
config.Redshift.hideVehicle = true    -- Hide EH if using a vehicle with an actionbar of its own. Does not affect vehicles that do not change the actionbar. If you use Vitals, you may want to set this to false. Default = true
config.Redshift.hideVitals = true    -- Hide EventHorizon_Vitals as well when the main frame is hidden. Default = true

config.Lines = nil            -- This draws extra marker lines on EventHorizon. Examples: config.Lines = 2 (add a line at 2 seconds in the future); config.Lines = {2, 4, 6} (add lines at 2, 4 and 6 seconds). Decimals and math are permitted, of course. Any amount of lines is allowed. Default: Disabled.
config.LinesColor = {1,1,1,0.5}      -- Standard color syntax {R,G,B,A} (see below). No classcolor allowed quite yet. Embed more tables for more colors. {{1,0,0,1},{0,1,0,1},{0,0.5,1}} will do one red line, one green line, and the rest kinda-teal lines. Yeah, it's a bit of an advanced thing.

config.anchor = {"TOPLEFT", "EventHorizonHandle", "BOTTOMLEFT"}  -- EventHorizon's position. Format: {'POINT', 'AnchorFrame', 'RELATIVE', Xoffset (optional), Yoffset (optional)}.

config.scale = 1            -- The overall scale of the main frame.
config.staticheight = 150        -- Changing this to a number will override config.height and tell EH to resize the bars instead of the frame. For example, 'config.staticheight = 150' will make EH 150 pixels tall. With 5 shown bars, each bar will be 30 pixels tall. Spacing is still used in this mode and will act the same as it does otherwise.
config.staticframes = 7          -- When used with config.staticheight, sets a minimum number of bars to use static height settings with. For example, with staticframes = 4 and 3 bars shown, EventHorizon will use normal variable height settings.
config.hideIcons = false        -- Hides the bar icons completely. This will make the frame a little more narrow, as config.height will no longer add to its width.

--[[ This table adjusts blending modes for most portions of EventHorizon. These are not normally usable on Statusbar objects, which EventHorizon is fairly unique about not using.
From wowprogramming.com's descriptions (which are very apt):
  'ADD' - Adds texture color values to the underlying color values, using the alpha channel; light areas in the texture lighten the background while dark areas are more transparent
  'ALPHAKEY' - One-bit transparency; pixels with alpha values greater than ~0.8 are treated as fully opaque and all other pixels are treated as fully transparent
  'BLEND' - Normal color blending, using any alpha channel in the texture image
  'DISABLE' - Ignores any alpha channel, displaying the texture as fully opaque
  'MOD'  - Ignores any alpha channel in the texture and multiplies texture color values by background color values; dark areas in the texture darken the background while light areas are more transparent

Setting blend modes to 'ADD' or 'MOD' can have a very nice effect.
Default (nil/false) is 'BLEND'.
Most entries in the color table support this, as demonstrated below. The backdrop and bar backgrounds are incompatible.

-- This little table judges the thickness and positioning of each bar element.
