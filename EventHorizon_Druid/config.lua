  -- The first spell bar is for Lifebloom. This huge note is so you can get Lifebloom to track your focus frame. As many healers, especially in a dungeon group, will set the tank as their focus so this seemed like a good addition however the default is the same mouseover behaviour as the other spells. Just change the comment markers "--" on the auraunit lines. Do this for the both "Lifebloom + Wild Growth CD" spell bars, I know that seemes excessive but it's the only way I could make it work for people who like being a Treant while healing and sometimes have Balance affinity.
